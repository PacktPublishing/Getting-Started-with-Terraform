#Getting Started with Terraform
This is the code repository for [Getting Started with Terraform](https://www.packtpub.com/networking-and-servers/getting-started-terraform?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781786465108), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book

##Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
host { 'repository.internal':
  ip => '192.168.0.5',
}
```

This book assumes a basic level of understanding the Linux operating system. The book will go through configuring numerous AWS resources. Being familiar with AWS is a plus, but is not required, as all required services will be explained. Usage of some cloud services in this book will require you to spend a dollar or two on them. Although the book assumes Linux as the primary workstation operating system, all of the content applies to MacOS and most of it will work the same way on Windows as well.
Internet connectivity is required to install the necessary tools, including Terraform. It is also required to perform any Terraform operations.
